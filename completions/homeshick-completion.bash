# The behavior of 'compgen -f' is pretty bizarre, in that if there's a
# directory 'foo', then compgen simply completes 'foo' and moves on, rather
# than offering to complete names of files underneath 'foo', which is what
# Bash (or Readline, actually) usually does.
#
# You can get the usual Readline filename completion behavior by doing
# 'complete -o default -F <func>', in which case the Readline filename
# completer is called if COMPREPLY=(). But this also means that you can no
# longer deny completion with COMPREPLY=() -- now Readline will always offer
# to complete a filename, even if this is inappropriate (e.g., the command
# takes no further arguments).
#
# In Bash 4.0 and above, there's a way to work around this problem. These
# versions have a 'compopt' builtin, which allows '-o default' to be enabled
# or disabled as needed. The workaround, then, is to disable '-o default'
# at the top of the completion function, and enable it as needed later on.
#
# For older Bash releases, there's a different workaround that doesn't work
# quite as well, but is still better than nothing. This workaround is to
# always enable '-o default' (which can't be disabled later), and then to use
# COMPREPLY=('') to semi-deny completion. That is, pressing Tab will just add
# space characters to the command line, rather than generating filenames.
